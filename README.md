<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

I started the project off searching for inspiration for the design of the application.
I found a couple of ideas I liked and took parts from each idea to build my own.
I sketched a basic design of how I wanted the application to look.
Once I had an idea I went into figma and started to design the application.
Before building the application I started making the Database with all the necessary information.
I started replicating the design from figma.
Once most of the design was in place, I started implementing the functionality.
I started with the Users, Doctors, Patients and then Appointments.
I worked on getting the functionality for adding and removing the data.
I worked on editing the data.
Finally I added all the missing functionality and additional things.


### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* Getting profile pictures to show.
